This cousrse work (CW) is dedicated to Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) and written in C++.
It was mainly coded under the supervision of A. Suslov at the university of Bath. Just download the folder and follow the readme.txt.
It is designed to extract and obtain data from a real time simulation into the data folder. I put some example data init, so one can run twitch the evaluation Notebook coded in Python (cluster.ipynb).
We extracted Fractal dimension under different Simulation conditions. 

My report is also available named as DLA.pdf.

Have Fun!
